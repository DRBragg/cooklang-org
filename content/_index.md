Cook is the markup language at the center of an open-source ecosystem for cooking and recipe management.

Together with tools based on it it aims to:
* simplify personal recipe management;
* reduce shopping routine;
* make cooking more fun.

> Cook ecosystem features:
> * Recipes are all in human-readable format.
> * Everything stored as files. That means it's easy to organize, share and improve your recipes as often as needed. Symlinks make its easy to create meal plans.
> * Embraces UNIX way: small but sharp tool for just one task.


## How to get started with Cook

Create a recipe file, tag ingredients with @ and now you have your recipe ready:

```
Then add @salt and @ground black pepper{} to taste.

Poke holes in @potato{2}.

Place @bacon strips{1%kg} on a baking sheet and glaze with @syrup{1/2%tbsp}.
```
