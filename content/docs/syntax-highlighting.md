## Sublime via Package Control

It is highly recommended to install Cooklang with Package Control as it automatically installs required dependencies and keeps all packages up to date.

1. Install Package Control if you haven't yet.
2. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` for Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` for Mac OS)
3. Search for `Package Control: Install Package` and hit Enter.
4. Type Cooklang and press Enter to install it.


## VSCode via Extensions

1. Find Cooklang using the Extensions View.
2. Install an extension.
