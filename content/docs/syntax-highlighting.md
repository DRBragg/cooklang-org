1. Install Package Control if you haven't yet. Go to Tools, then click Install Package Control...
2. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` for Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` for Mac OS)
3. Search for `Package Control: Install Package` and hit Enter.
4. Type CookLang and press Enter to install it.


## VSCode via Extensions

1. Find CookLang using the Extensions View.
2. Install an extension.
