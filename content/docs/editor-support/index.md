1. Install Package Control if you haven't yet.
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P for Mac OS)
3. Search for Package Control: Install Package and hit Enter.
4. Type CookLang and press Enter to install it.


## VSCode via Extensions

1. Find CookLang using the Extensions View.
2. Install an extension.
