### Intellectual Property

The intellectual property in the materials in CooklangApp and on our website are owned by or licensed to Alexey Dubovskoy. You may download CooklangApp to view, use and display the application on your mobile device for your personal use only.

This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions or these Terms of Service and may be terminated by Alexey Dubovskoy at any time.

### Automatic Updates

You give us permission to download and install updates to CooklangApp on your device in accordance with your privacy preferences. This permission can be revoked at any time by deleting CooklangApp from your device.

### Liability

CooklangApp and the materials in CooklangApp and on our website are provided on an 'as is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Alexey Dubovskoy makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.

In no event shall Alexey Dubovskoy or its suppliers be liable for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising from the use or inability to use CooklangApp, our website, or any other services provided by Alexey Dubovskoy or the materials in CooklangApp, even if Alexey Dubovskoy or an authorised representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.

In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity or otherwise.

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

### Accuracy of Materials

The materials appearing in CooklangApp or on our website are not comprehensive and are for general information purposes only. To the extent permitted by law, Alexey Dubovskoy does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials in CooklangApp or on our website, or otherwise relating to such materials or on any resources linked to CooklangApp and our website.
